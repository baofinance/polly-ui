		<NestHeader>Description</NestHeader>
		<p>
			The Polly DeFi Nest is divided into key DeFi sectors, which are given a
			weighting reflecting their maturity and share of the overall market.
			Within those sectors, each project is weighted on the TVL divided by Fully
			Diluted Valuation (FDV).
		</p>
		<Spacer />
		<NestHeader>Objective</NestHeader>
		<p>
			To generate revenue a defi project needs value deposited into their
			contracts. This makes Total Value Locked (TVL) a key metric for evaluating
			a project's ability to generate revenue. Projects with a high TVL are also
			likely to gain more traction in the market through the network effects the
			existing capital provides - capital attracts more capital. A good example
			of this is with Yearn Finance. Yearn was able to generate massive amounts
			of revenue as a result of the large amount of capital they attracted. This
			gave them the resources to further develop and innovate their products in
			a positive feedback loop. Yearn’s success has led to many projects such as
			Alchemix and Abracadabra using their products and liquidity as a base
			layer to build on.
		</p>
		<p>
			nDEFI is composed of the strongest components in the DeFi ecosystem,
			striving to provide core coverage of the key building blocks for the
			future of finance. With nDEFI you’ll have exposure to infrastructure,
			lending markets, decentralized exchanges, synthetics, and yield
			aggregators. The unique weighting formula allows the nest to invest in
			projects gaining traction earlier and with a greater weighting than market
			cap weighted nests.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Polly DeFi Nest will provide the crypto industry's first automated
			value investing, decentralized, tokenized portfolios. When you add the
			prospect of the underlying tokens being put to work to earn yield.

		<NestHeader>Criteria</NestHeader>
		<p>
			For a project to be included in the Polly Defi Nest, it must fit the below
			criteria in order to reduce the risk of the nest and fit the desires of
			the community.
		</p>
		<NestSubHeader>Characteristics</NestSubHeader>
		<NestList>
			<li>Be a DeFi project available on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
			<li>Listed on DefiLlama</li>
			<li>
				Have at least 7.5% of the total supply in circulation and have a
				predictable token emission over the next 5 years.
			</li>
			<li>
				The protocols will be selected by TVL based on DeFiLlama’s website.
			</li>
			<li>
				The protocol must be running for 3 months before qualifying to be
				included in the nest.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the event of a safety incident, the team must have addressed the
				problem responsibly and promptly, providing users of the protocol a
				reliable solution and document a detailed, transparent breakdown of the
				incident.
			</li>
			<li>Be Ethereum-focused</li>
			<li>Must be sufficiently decentralised</li>
		</NestList>
		<Spacer />
		<NestHeader>Strategy</NestHeader>
		<p>
			It is possible for the underlying tokens to utilize strategies that will
			earn yield, maximising value for nest holders, who benefit from this
			productivity without having to perform any actions themselves. These
			strategies will be changed over time to take advantage of new
			opportunities or to maximise the yield earned.
		</p>
		<Spacer />
		<NestHeader>Management</NestHeader>
		<p>The Nest is maintained quarterly in two phases.</p>
		<p>
			<NestSubHeader>Determination Phase</NestSubHeader>
		</p>
		<p>
			The determination phase takes place during the final 2 weeks of the
			quarter. During this phase the changes needed for the next reconstitution
			are determined. The TVL and FDV of each project are recorded, including
			new projects that qualify for the nest and meet the criteria.
		</p>
		<p>
			Proposed changes will be published on the governance forum for 1 week then
			a governance vote will run for the community to approve changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<NestSubHeader>Reconstitution Phase</NestSubHeader>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the two weeks following a successful vote, the nest components will be
			adjusted as per the instructions published during the final 2 weeks of the
			quarter.
